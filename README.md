Demostration project to show how to make a monorepo website for blogging

## Getting started

The project is devided between the `backend` and `frontend` with their respective folders. The `backend` will use a Node app using Express, while the `frontend` will be a React app.

To get the app up and running, first install the each project's dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Then start the `backend` first and then the `frontend`:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your default browser should open up and take you to `http://localhost:3001` with the React app rendered.
